# Toggle Editor Mode
Click button to enable Editor mode on Singleplayer and Sandbox.
<br>
Does not work on Multiplayer and Campaign
<br>
<br>
Changelog:
<br>
Added workaround that lets you exit a game while in "false editor mode" (the editor mode toggled by the button)
<br>
The mod now shouldn't interfere with "true editor mode" (the editor mode accessed from the map editor)
